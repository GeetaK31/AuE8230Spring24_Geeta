I am Geeta Koduri. I am a masters student, Automotive engineering program at Clemson University.
This repository consists of 2 codes:
circle.py: This code sets the linear velocity to 0.5 meters per second and the angular velocity to 1.0 radians per second. The turtle will move in a circle with radius of approximately 0.5 meters. The while loop will continue untill the program is terminated. The Turtle move in a circle with constant twist velocity. 
square_openloop.py:The code moves the Turtle in a square of 2x2 units with 0.2 linear velocity and 0.2 rad/s angular velocity. The turtle moves in staraight line and then turns by 90 degrees and repeats the process three more times to complete the square. The while loop will continue untill the program is terminated.
